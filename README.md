Basic Game Story from winning submission:


NOTE: ALL IDEAS HERE CAN BE CHANGED THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPEMENT PROCESS. THESE ARE JUST THE IDEAS OF THE SUBMISSION, BUT THEY ARE STILL THE BASIS OF THE GAME

<vetoed>//16 bit, cute, chibi, pastel-colored form
<new art style>dead cells type style, semi cartoonish
multiple playable characters, and at least one romance

For a combat system, one could have multiple step inputs, not unlike street fighter or tekken.

There can be stages in a megaman-like sense, with each stage a different setting
urban/industrial setting
People can make original characters to place as bosses. Defeating a boss will unlock them.

Story:
bosses leave graphic effects on the game, and your goal is to return the game to normal. Defeating bosses changes a graphics style.
