NOTE: ALL IDEAS HERE CAN BE CHANGED THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPEMENT PROCESS. THESE ARE JUST THE IDEAS OF THE SUBMISSION, BUT THEY ARE STILL THE BASIS OF THE GAME

|vetoed|//16 bit, cute, chibi, pastel-colored form
multiple playable characters, and at least one romance

For a combat system, one could have multiple step inputs, not unlike street fighter or tekken.

There can be stages in a megaman-like sense, with each stage a different setting
urban/industrial setting
People can make original characters to place as bosses. Defeating a boss will unlock them.
